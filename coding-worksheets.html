                <p>Through completing the set coding worksheets I gained so many skills which have enabled me to complete my flexbox website. These include things such as making buttons, inserting photos and videos, colouring text and many more. I also completed the optional carousel worksheet where I learnt additional skills which I have incorporated into my CARP project website page and my typography systems website page. Through completing the carousel worksheet I also used some short code snippets from the web page referenced here. Coyier, C.C. / Organisation (2022) CSS-Only Carousel.
