                    <p>From doing research into other skateboarding posters online I noticed a common theme of titles using very bold colours which influenced me to choose the bright red colour in this poster. In addition to bold colours, lots of skateboarding posters used very bold fonts to stand out to readers which helped me in choosing my font as I wanted to ensure it was bold and eye-catching. The dynamic photo I've used for the main background of my poster is a photo which caught my eye due to the effect of the film camera and fish-eye lens it created. The photo is also fitting for this project as it is a female skateboarder so matches the design brief of the girls skateboard clinic. </p>

                <div class="test1">
                    <p>In this poster design, I wanted to incorporate bold features and this was achieved through the utilisation of the bold text and colour to generate this eye-catching poster. I played around with this idea of boldness through using a deep orange colour which contrasted well with the darker background. This was something I wanted to carry forward into my final design because of how effective it looked. The other text which was still important but should be noticed after the title so I wanted it to remain visible for the audience but not overpower the other text. To do this I utilised white text as it contrasts the background but isn't dominant compared to the orange. To link to the brief I used a dynamic image of a female skateboarding to ensure it remained on theme. An aspect of the photo which positively contributed to the poster was the shadow, it added depth to this poster. </p>

                <div class="test2">
                    <p>In this poster design, I used a khaki background as I think the colour fits in well with the skateboard theme and I really like how it contrasts with other colours especially white and black. I managed to tweak the logo so that it matched well with the khaki background which I liked and took forward into my other 2 designs by making sure the logo matches with the colour themes. I also included photos and made it look like a scrap book which is something I thought looked really effective and something I wanted to include in my other designs. All my photos are of female skateboarders which I wanted to ensure I did so it matches the design brief of a poster for a girls skateboard clinic. </p>
