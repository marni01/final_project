            <h3>OVERALL REFLECTION:</h3>
            <h2>I have learnt so much throughout the process of creating this project. At the beginning I had no idea how to even start coding a website or what CSS even was! The coding websheets really helped me when making the flexbox website and meant my confidence grew as I learnt and practised more. They gave me so much help and so many skills which I incorporated in my website. I also completed the optional carousel worksheet which I used on my CARP project page and my typography systems page. I'm glad I did this as I feel like it really upgrades my website and makes it more interactive for the viewers. As a whole, making my website was very tricky due to it being my first time ever making a HTML CSS website so it required a lot of learning but I really like how it turned out and I tried to get out of my comfort zone and not take the easy routes. I really enjoyed the CARP project as I really enjoy creative projects and this gave me lots of creative freedom whilst making the posters. The design brief was also very cool and something I'm interested in which also made this part of the project very fun. As i've never used any Adobe software before it took a while to get the hang of it all but once i'd worked out all the functions it was very enjoyable! Making the typography systems was very interesting as I've never looked into typography before so didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with how eye-catching and engaging they can make text for the viewer. Again I hadn't used Adobe Illustrator before so was very unfamiliar with it all but once I had played around with all the tools and functions it was a lot easier. Overall, I really enjoyed this project especially the creative freedom of creating everything myself with my own personal styles and colour pallets whilst sticking to briefs. I also liked using software I have never used before and learning completely new skills such as HTML and CSS, both of which I had never done before in my life but I feel much more confident now which, compared to how clueless I was at the start, is a big thing!. Despite finding it all very challenging at times, I had a lot of fun and am proud of the work I've achieved.</h2>
