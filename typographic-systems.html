            <div class="typographic-reflections">
                <div class="axial">
                    <p>Axial:
                        Axial designs are centred around axes or lines, therefore when designing this typographic system it was important for me to ensure the text and the shapes are organised in this structure. The art gallery name is coloured in a teal colour and is the centre axis for the other text as I felt like it was the most important piece of information.
                         </p>
                </div>
                <div class="radial">
                    <p>Radial:
                        The radial design is centred around a clear central point which can be seen in this typographic system. The text and shapes utilised are beaming off the circle (central point) like sun rays with shapes in between for extra design elements.
                         </p>
                </div>
                <div class="dilatational">
                    <p>Dilatational:
                        The dilatational design expands from a central point. I have utilised the teal colour in the circle as this holds important information and then other aspects of the text which are seen in black are dilating from this teal colour in a circular shape.
                         </p>
                </div>
                <div class="random">
                    <p>Random:
                        In this typography system, both the shapes and text are arranged in random places with a range of different angles so there is no order or structure to it. Furthermore certain shapes were created using the pen tool to ensure no clear structure.                         
                         </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid">
                    <p>Grid:
                        The grid has clear boxes and structures created by the organisation of text and shapes. It has been arranged into squares and rectangles to create this grid effect. The rectangle shape and the text in teal has been used as margins; to contribute to this grid effect. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="modular">
                    <p>Modular:
                        The shape I used was squares which I repeated in the shape of a pyramid to create my modular typography system. The repeated colour of teal for each square with the writing allows for this sense of repetition and organisation. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="transitional">
                    <p>Transitional:
                        The transitional design here follows the textured planes of the text and shapes. Here it shows how the text follows from left to right in an almost ‘wave’ like form to create this texture and layered appearance. This idea of texture is further communicated through the use of teal for the shapes in which it creates this ‘wave’ appearance. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="bilateral">
                    <p>Bilateral:
                        The text and shapes have been organised on a single axis, the eyeline goes from top to bottom of the axis, following a clear structured order to the typographic system. I also used colour, shape and a range of text sizes to give it more design elements and make it more appealing and engaging. 
                        </p>
